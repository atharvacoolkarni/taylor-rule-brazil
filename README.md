# Project Overview

This project analyzes **Brazil’s monetary policy using the Taylor Rule framework**.  
The main goals were:
- Apply the Taylor Rule to Brazil’s economic data to model interest rate decisions  
- Compare actual central bank policies with Taylor Rule predictions  
- Visualize the relationship between inflation, output gap, and policy rates over time  

The study uses empirical data, economic modeling, and visualizations to assess how closely Brazil’s policy aligns with standard monetary guidelines.
